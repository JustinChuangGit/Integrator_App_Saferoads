## Project Description 
Saferoads Engineering's research and development division is responsible for designing highway safety products. This involves conducting crash tests to assess the effectiveness of these products. My primary role in the organization included both conducting these tests and constructing devices to facilitate their execution. To maintain consistency across various crash labs, standardized protocols, Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware (MASH), are in place. A critical variable in these tests is the collision speed. Since the crash vehicles all have acceleration data, I had the idea to build an integrator app that would display both acceleration and velocity data. 

## My Contributions
I chose to learn Dart and the Flutter framework to develop a desktop application capable of processing acceleration data files and conducting essential calculations to generate precise velocity data. However, during the integration phase, I discovered that Python outperformed Dart in terms of efficiency with extremely large data sets. Consequently, I decided to leverage Python, with Flask serving as the backend for the program to compute all necessary calculations.

## Results 
The program was able to successfully compute accurate velocity data. It cut down the original process of retrieving the velocity from the highspeed video by 90%.
